Hi PNNL Energise team,

Here are some notes for our code.

1. comment out the using LinearAlgebra, as in Julia 1.0, using a function like dot() and norm() require that package.
2. the reading CSV syntax is different for Julia 1.0 and Julia 0.7, that is used in 1)example.jl and 2) GML.jl function GML_output
3. The GML_output function is only used for generating a csv file contains information for FOL. Actually, the output of GML is the input for FOL, therefore generating a CSV file is not necessary. 
4. If you decide to leave out generating the CSV file, please comment out the GML_otput(Opt_value) (line 30) and whole function GML_output (line 423-439) in file GML.jl
5. In the example file, you can find we read the data from the CSV file provided by UVM. Therefore, if you want to read data of another day, change the k or extract the specific date and make another CSV file of the same format as provided by UVM.
6. Last but not least, our output of GML is of size 12 x 288.

Best,

Chengda
